  	<h1 style="line-height: 1.2em;">Methodology for the development of technological artifact</h1>
<h2>Possible steps for applied science</h2>

<p>Any design process usually starts with a brainstorming. Possible "tools" for brainstorming are:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Structured reading (it is important to imitatet first)</li>
	<li>Presentations (catch impulses, write diary, present)</li>
	<li>Discussion (spontaneous are often useful, criticize)</li>
	<li>Cooperation (working in groups)</li>
	<li>Experimentation (both with touchables and thoughts)</li>
	<li>Simplification (make assumptions to limit the scope)</li>
	<li>Decomposition (divide a complex problem; 3 actions: measure -> model -> manage)</li>
	<li>Clarification (requirements analysis & specification)</li>
</ul>

<p>During the project work, establish several documents and update them during the project.</p>

<ol>
<li>Provide a short formulation for what a project is (potentially a description of a problem you want to solve), f. ex. "develop a system in blockchain for student evaluation in a learning environment"</li>

<li>Formulate the project goals (performance goals,  f. ex. "demonstrate that a group of people can establish a market for exchanging loyalty coins related to their contribution in a learning environment with specified learning objectives" and some effect goals like "understand better the applications of blockchain" or "develop a new type of learning community") </li>

<li>Identify the need for the artifact (a thing you want to make, create, build, etc.), f. ex. "common learning systems are hierarchical and there is always one authority evaluating different aspects of learners skills and knowledge; applying blockchain <i>philosophy</i> and architectures we can experiment with in a network/community of actors that in the beginning are equal and the evaluation is always based on the consensus in the network/community; the artifact will make it possible to maintain and develop a learning communities in specific contexts")</li>

<li>Analyze the need for the artifact (to find out if the artifact is too compound for a realization and potentially do decomposition, f. ex. instead of aiming for a prototype in a real blockchain, we can test the model based on paper prototype and simulations)</li>

<li>Document the need for the artifact (it might be a formulation of some success criteria, like "a blockchain-based system can be verified by a network of 40 students")</li>

<li>Check out the research front or if someone has already made something similar (your work can also be to prove a concept developed by others by reimplementing the artifact or testing out if the other artifact satisfies the specification of your artifact; structured reading can be used as a method for this task, f. ex. you could search for a similar project on the internet that describes similar artifacts to that you are aiming to implement)</li>

<li>Do planning:</li>
<ul>	
	<li>Make an initial schedule for your project taking into consideration all necessary parts of a [systems development] project, f. ex. including brainstorming sessions (analysis), design and [potential] implementation of the artifact</li>
	
  <li>Make a plan for evaluation (many methods to choose from: prototyping, experimental simulation, field experiment, field study, data simulation, maths, logic, questionnaire, interviews, laboratory experiment, etc.); if writing code is a part of your project, you should also develop a plan for testing</li> 

	<li>Make a plan for documentation, - you should strive to document in a way that others might be able to control your results and potentially repeat your investigations and your experiments. <br /> 
Several types of documentation can be considered:
		<ul>
			<li>documentation of the architecture and the structure of the artifact (as detailed architecture as possible)</li>

			<li>documentation of the setup and context for the evaluation of the artifact (f. ex. "using Ethereum blockchain for the implementation of a user interface for an evaluation system")</li>

			<li>documentation of the type of data related to the artifact (f. ex. "the data is collected from all users in the network and represents some metrics (a set of numbers or tokens that give information about a particular process or activity) for the evaluation of contribution to learning environment and achieving learning objectives")</li>

			<li>documentation of the materials used in the project (f. ex. "participants uses their mobile devices, laptops and different wearables to provide transaction date into the blockchain that is deployed in a cloud environment")</li>

			<li>documentation of the interpretation and analysis of the data and materials (f. ex. "how the data is analyzed before the transaction is approved and which kind of consensus algorithms are used")</li>

			<li>documentation of the argumentations and deductions (based on mathematical analysis, logical deductions or even informal deduction based on common sense)</li>
			<li>documentation of different types of tests (you should be familiar with those from other courses; f. ex. "testing the performance of the network under an estimated optimal load")</li>
		</ul>
</ul>
