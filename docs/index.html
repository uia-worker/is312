    <h1>About IS-312</h1>

    <cite>Beware of hollow extactness, because it is the same as exact emptiness. (Mario Bunge)</cite>
    

    <h2>
      Basic concepts and timeline
      <a name="concepts"></a>
    </h2>

    <p> The concept of blockchain was introduced in computer science by David Chaum in 1982 (dissertation "Computer Systems Established, Maintained, and Trusted by Mutually Suspicious Groups"). He basically introduced only one specific part of the current understanding of the blockchain, - online anonymity. The technology that the concept of blockchain encompass was developed in 1970s under the name of <b>distributed database</b>.</p>



    <p>
      The timeline for the conceptual and practical <i>evolution</i> of the blockchain concept suggested by Sherman et al. (2019):
      <pre>
1970 James Ellis, public-key cryptography discovered at GCHQ in secret
1973 Clifford Cocks, RSA cryptosystem discovered at GCHQ in secret
1974 Ralph Merkle, cryptographic puzzles (paper published in 1978)
1976 Diffie and Hellman, public-key cryptography discovered at Stanford
1977 Rivest, Shamir, Adleman, RSA cryptosystem invented at MIT
1979 David Chaum, vaults and secret sharing (dissertation 1982)
1982 Lamport, Shostak, Pease, Byzantine Generals Problem
(1991 (Haber & Stornetta, 1991)) How to time-stamp a digital document?
1992 Dwork and Naor, combating junk mail
2002 Adam Bach, Hashcash
2008 Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin
2017 Wright and Savanah, nChain European patent application (issued in 2018)
2018 The European Commission launched the Blockchain Observatory and Forum
(2022 Ethereum changed to Proof-Of-State)
      </pre>
      <ul>
        <li>items in parenthesis are added by the authors of this document</li>
        <li>GCHQ - Government Communications Headquarters (United Kingdom)</li>

      </ul>
    </p>
   
    <p>This, by no means complete, timeline invite us to assume that we will be talking about very complex artifact. In this short course we will only be able to get some "breadcumbs the baked goods". It is tempting to put the analysis into a broader perspective (or as saying goes <i>look at it with a broader lens</i>). An a broader lens might be philosophical, sociological and, no doubt, also psychological. Mario Bunge introduces a general model for philosophical analysis of human endevours, which consists of 4 basic parts:
    <ul>
      <li>Biology</li>
      <li>Culture</li>
      <li>Polity (a form or process of civil government or constitution)</li>
      <li>Economy</li>
    </ul> 
    We are going to use this model in a socio-technological approach to understand the pecularities of the idea of blockchain. We will work with social aspects interchangably with technological ones. For the social part you will describe the formation of your mental model related to <i>blockchain</i>. For the techonological part we will work together on some technological "breadcumbs" of the implementation of blockchain into an available infrastructure of information processing units (see <a href="https://uia-worker.github.io/is311/#concepts">description</a> of IPU). Techological artifacts can be viewed as a part of cultural artifacts, i. e. part of the "Culture" part of Bunge's model.
    </p>
    <p>Regarding <i>learning theories</i> this course is definitively leaning on <i>social constructivism</i> (Main, 2023). Our objective is to encourage discussions and ideas. You will work independently, in groups or in pairs interchangably. Decision-making (evaluation) will be shared between teachers and students (formative evaluation/feedback). You will study real-world scenarious (like using smart contracts instead of common written contracts in different use cases), some journal articles ( f.ex. Wright & De Filippi, 2015) ) and possibly some excerpts from books (we find some sources collaboratively). It is expected that you particiapate in all 7 workshops.</p>

  <tr>
    <td>Student have knowledge about models for blockchains currently in use</td>
    <td>Both "knowledge" and "models" are ambiguous concepts. What does it mean to have a knowledge about something? Let us say that it is to have a mental model in one's brain, that an individual is able to associate with some specific phenomenon inside himself or in the surroundings (environment). So in this context "knowledge about models" would be a (personally interpreted and therefore psychological) knowledge about other's mental models regarding the phenomenon (or buzzword?) Blockchain. Definition in Cambridge Dictionary (Cambridge Dictionary, 2023a) states that the Blockchain is <cite>a system used to make a digital record of all the occasions a cryptocurrency (= a digital currency such as bitcoin) is bought or sold, and that is constantly growing as more blocks are added.</cite> According to Oxford English Dictionary (Blockchain - Quick Search Results | Oxford English Dictionary, 2023) the Blockchain is <cite>A sequence of digital records linked using encryption and distributed and managed typically in a peer-to-peer network used esp. by cryptocurrencies as a secure and verifiable ledger of transactions; the technology underpinning this.</cite> A definition from Vikram Dhillon states <cite>A blockchain is a decentralized data structure with internal consistency maintained through consensus reached by all the users on the current state of the network.</cite> (Vikram Dhillon, 2021). Another author (Christophe Schinckus, 2020) provides the following description: <cite>Blockchain is a buzzword describing the current excitement for an innovative technology that could change and disrupt major industries and economic sectors. Blockchain technology has the promise to change all existing business models and make financial services cheaper contributing therefore to a better financial inclusion and, even a better economic wealth distribution.</cite>
 <br /> 
The definitions above indicate a considerable ambiguity of the blockchain concept, but they are not logically incompatibele. Blockchain can be considered as a system for storing digital records (or data structures) in a network of users (peers) engaged in transactions with each other (possibly transactions of some tokens that can represent money or anything) and keeping the stored records immutable (or safe by cryptological or other means) based on a consesus reached by all (ideally) peers in the network. This also can imply that each peer in the network has its own copy of all digital records made in this network. In other words, a network of users is collectivelly keeping verifiable digital records about activities in the network. The term "ledger" is often used, probably because of the similarity with the historical ledger concept from the accounting.
<br /> 
Why such an artifact (an implemented system called blockchain) is necessary? The answer to this question will be a large part of discussion in IS-312. For now, one hypothesis might be that it (blockchain) mirrors particular movements in parts of thee homo sapiens society, in particular, with an emphasis on mechanisms for exchange of value (related to both tangible and intangible assets) between the members or groups from the homo sapiens society.
<br />
<br />
  <cite>Blockchain is a disruptive technology that is revolutionizing information technology and represents a change in the cultural paradigm for how information is shared. Companies are rushing to understand how they can use blockchain technology to innovate processes, products, and transactions.  Blockchain technology is contributing to sustainable development goals (SDGs) from different points of view, such as supporting the realization of a sustainable supply chain, improving energy efficiency, enabling a circular economy, and promoting the creation of secure a and reliable smart cities. </cite>
  <cite>NFT use-cases will only grow in the future, and developers may eventually be able to tie them to everyday activities like ticket sales, proof of attendance, and fraud detection. Globally, the largest part of NFTs is represented by digital art, sports, and the entertainment industry, but there are countless potential areas of application of NFTs, such as tourism, carbon offsets, energy efficiency, virtual real estate, and consumer & luxury goods. Certain platforms have gone a step further into the virtual reality to showcase the NFTs to the extent of that reality. The emergence of mixed reality offers more collectibles and marketing opportunities which will stimulate more growth.</cite> (EBCW 2022 • 6.-7. October 2023, Slovenia, 2023)
