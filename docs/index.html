      <p>Blockchain is a software and network architecture based on the basic architecture of the Internet. The main element of the architecture is a distributed storage of information and communication between agents to reach consensus. Models have been developed for valuing goods and services, and new models are constantly being implemented based on laws and regulations for the exchange of values between individuals and between larger groups. This architecture is promoted by the diversified interests of individuals and groups, and even if it is volatile, it already has a relatively large influence on some key processes in the society. An example is the processing of personal and locally stored data. Examples of relevant student projects are an election system, a chat service with strong privacy, a rating system of specific skills, a cryptocurrency system and other systems based on consensus between two or more agents.</p>

    <td>Both "knowledge" and "models" are ambiguous concepts. What does it mean to have a knowledge about something? Let us say that it is to have a mental model in one's brain, that an individual is able to associate with some specific phenomenon inside himself or in the surroundings (environment). So in this context "knowledge about models" would be a (personally interpreted and therefore psychological) knowledge about other's mental models regarding the phenomenon Blockchain. Definition in Cambridge Dictionary (Cambridge Dictionary, 2023a) states that the Blockchain is <cite>a system used to make a digital record of all the occasions a cryptocurrency (= a digital currency such as bitcoin) is bought or sold, and that is constantly growing as more blocks are added</cite>. According to Oxford English Dictionary (Blockchain - Quick Search Results | Oxford English Dictionary, 2023) the Blockchain is <cite>A sequence of digital records linked using encryption and distributed and managed typically in a peer-to-peer network ...</cite> <br />

    <td>"a problem" in this context is the problem suggested by students that they want to solve based on their knowledge and skills related to the IoT. Deployments of the electronical devices, which makes the base of the IoT, to a subdomain are grounded in the theory of electromagnetism, but in the hyped IoT context theories specific to the suggested subdomain can also be relevant (multi-agent systems, game theory, computational theories, theories from informations systems field, ...). From the engineering perspectiv methods from systems development are relevant for IoT projects (IS-104, IS-114, IS-20x). In addition, methods for applied science should be known for students. Read an <a href="devart.html" target="_blank">additional document</a> for an introduction to a possible methodology for the development of artifacts. You can also take a look at some guidelines about the processes for the design and develompment of "things" for "taking a them to the market". (Teel, 2016).</td>

      Tentative plan
      <a name="plan"></a>
    </h2>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>8 x 13 hours - total for 5 ECTS</li>
        <li>7 x 3 hours - acitivities with supervision</li>
        <li>~80 hours - self-organized project work (groups should plan for this carefully)</li>
      </ul>
    The course is based on meetings for creative thinking and problem solving. The students generate groups of 3-6 students by themselves, work on finding a relevant project (specifies the problem to be solved) and work on prototypes. Any other week the groups present their project status in a forum (4 presentations). At the end of the course an oral exam is arranged to evaluate the students' work. </p>
