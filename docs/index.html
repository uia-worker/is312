      Basic concepts

    <p>From course description in 2021</p>
    <p>Blockchain is an ambiguous concept. It is called buzzword (Christophe Schinckus, 2020) by some authors. The realization of blockchain is dependent on the Internet architecture. Let as assume that the Internet reflects  communication systems of homo sapiens. The communication systems of homo sapiens are highly dynamic but they have some common characteristics. Homo sapiens can do things to achieve particular goals driven by non-deterministic (irrational, random, chaotic) motivations and in their workflow to a goal they have to acquire or distribute different resources. Homo sapiens have developed power relations and management patterns for the administration, ownership, and exchange of both physical (tangible) and abstract (intangible) resources.
    <br />
    National state based law and rules are stating different rights for different individuals, groups, and transaction types. Majority of law and rules have been created during the last, at least, 500 years, and are related to the development of printing. In the 21st century, industrial (or should we say information-based?) societies are made themselves dependent on digital information exchange. Many assets of relations, like agreements, consensus, and contracts have also moved to digital media. Internet, WWW, Tor, darknet and blockchain are all assets of digital media.</p>

    <p>Blockchain is a software and network architecture based on the basic architecture of the Internet. The main elements of the blockchain architectures are distributed storage units and communication protocols used by [autonomous] agents to reach a consensus. Models have been developed for valuing goods and services, and new models are constantly being implemented based on laws and regulations for the exchange of values between individuals and between larger groups. This architecture is promoted by the diversified interests of individuals and groups, and even if it is volatile, it already has a relatively large influence on some key processes in the society. An example is the processing of personal and locally stored data. Examples of relevant student projects are an election system, a chat service with strong privacy, a rating system of specific skills, a cryptocurrency system and other systems based on consensus between two or more agents.</p>

    <td>Student have knowledge about models for blockchains currently in use</td>
    <td>Both "knowledge" and "models" are ambiguous concepts. What does it mean to have a knowledge about something? Let us say that it is to have a mental model in one's brain, that an individual is able to associate with some specific phenomenon inside himself or in the surroundings (environment). So in this context "knowledge about models" would be a (personally interpreted and therefore psychological) knowledge about other's mental models regarding the phenomenon (or buzzword?) Blockchain. Definition in Cambridge Dictionary (Cambridge Dictionary, 2023a) states that the Blockchain is <cite>a system used to make a digital record of all the occasions a cryptocurrency (= a digital currency such as bitcoin) is bought or sold, and that is constantly growing as more blocks are added.</cite> According to Oxford English Dictionary (Blockchain - Quick Search Results | Oxford English Dictionary, 2023) the Blockchain is <cite>A sequence of digital records linked using encryption and distributed and managed typically in a peer-to-peer network used esp. by cryptocurrencies as a secure and verifiable ledger of transactions; the technology underpinning this.</cite> A definition from Vikram Dhillon states <cite>A blockchain is a decentralized data structure with internal consistency maintained through consensus reached by all the users on the current state of the network.</cite> (Vikram Dhillon, 2021). Another author (Christophe Schinckus, 2020) provides the following description <cite>Blockchain is a buzzword describing the current excitement for an innovative technology that could change and disrupt major industries and economic sectors. Blockchain technology has the promise to change all existing business models and make financial services cheaper contributing therefore to a better financial inclusion and, even a better economic wealth distribution.</cite>
 <br /> 
The definitions above indicate a considerable ambiguity of the blockchain concept, but they are not logically incompatibele. Blockchain can be considered as a system for storing digital records (or data structures) in a network of users (peers) engaged in transactions with each other (possibly transactions of some tokens representing money) and keeping the stored records immutable (or safe by cryptological or other means) based on a consesus reached by all peers in the network. This also can imply that each peer in the network has its own copy of all digital records made in this network. In other words, a network of users is collectivelly keeping verifiable digital records about activities in the network. The term "ledger" is often used, probably because of the similarity with the historical ledger concept from the accounting.
<br /> 
Why such an artifact (an implemented system called blockchain) is necessary? The answer to this question will be a large part of discussion in IS-312. For now, one hypothesis might be that it (blockchain) mirrors particular movements in parts of thee homo sapiens society, in particular, with an emphasis on mechanisms for exchange of value (related to both tangible and intangible assets) between the members or groups from the homo sapiens society.

From the engineering perspective the familiarity with the methods from the systems development (IS-104, IS-114, IS-20x) and understanding of networks in general (IS-105) are relevant for the blockchain related projects. In addition, methods for the applied science should be known for the students.

      Tentative plan
      <a name="plan"></a>
    </h2>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>8 x 13 hours - total for 5 ECTS</li>
        <li>7 x 3 hours - acitivities with supervision</li>
        <li>~80 hours - self-organized project work (groups should plan for this carefully)</li>
      </ul>
    The course is based on meetings for creative thinking and problem solving. The students generate groups of 3-6 students by themselves, work on finding a relevant project (specifies the problem to be solved) and work on prototypes. Any other week the groups present their project status in a forum (4 presentations). At the end of the course an oral exam is arranged to evaluate the students' work. </p>
