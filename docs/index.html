    <p> (Janis) Blockchain is an ambiguous concept. It is called buzzword by some authors (Christophe Schinckus, 2020). The realization of blockchain is dependent on the Internet architecture. Let as assume that the Internet reflects  communication systems of homo sapiens. The communication systems of homo sapiens are highly dynamic but they have some common characteristics. Homo sapiens can do things to achieve particular goals driven by non-deterministic (irrational, random, chaotic) motivations and in their workflow to a goal they have to acquire or distribute different resources. Homo sapiens have developed power relations and management patterns for the administration, ownership, and exchange of both physical (tangible) and abstract (intangible) resources.

    <p>(C-GPT) The concept of blockchain is often described as ambiguous and has been labeled as a buzzword by certain authors, such as Christophe Schinckus in 2020. Understanding the implementation of blockchain technology requires recognizing its intricate connection to the architecture of the Internet.</p>

    <p>(C-GPT) To illustrate this relationship, let's consider the Internet as a reflection of the dynamic communication systems employed by Homo sapiens. Despite their dynamism, these systems share common traits. Within the realm of Homo sapiens' activities, diverse actions are undertaken to achieve specific objectives. These actions are often driven by non-deterministic motivations, characterized as irrational, random, or even chaotic. Along the journey towards these objectives, the acquisition and distribution of various resources play a pivotal role.</p>

    <p>(C-GPT) Throughout the course of human history, Homo sapiens have evolved systems of power relations and management practices to oversee the administration, ownership, and exchange of resources. These resources encompass not only tangible, physical assets but also intangible, abstract ones.</p>

    
    <p> (Janis) National state based laws and rules are stating different rights for different individuals, groups, and transaction types. Majority of law and rules have been created during the last, at least, 500 years, and are related to the development of printing. In the 21st century, industrial (or should we say information-based?) societies are made themselves dependent on digital information exchange. Many assets of relations, like agreements, consensus, and contracts have also moved to digital media. Internet, WWW, Tor, darknet and blockchain are all assets of digital media.</p>

    <p>(C-GPT) National state-based laws and regulations allocate distinct rights to various individuals, groups, and types of transactions. The majority of these legal frameworks have been established over the past five centuries, closely tied to the evolution of printing technology. However, as we progress into the 21st century, societies, primarily information-based, have grown increasingly reliant on digital information exchange.</p>

    <p>(C-GPT) Numerous facets of human interactions, including agreements, consensus, and contracts, have transitioned into the realm of digital media. Notably, the Internet, World Wide Web (WWW), Tor network, darknet, and blockchain technology represent integral components of this digital landscape.</p>

    <p>Blockchain is a software and network architecture based on the basic architecture of the Internet. The main elements of the blockchain architectures are distributed storage units and communication protocols used by [autonomous] agents to reach a consensus. Models have been developed for valuing goods and services, and new models are constantly being implemented based on laws and regulations for the exchange of values between individuals and between larger groups. This architecture is promoted by the diversified interests of individuals and groups, and even if it is volatile, it already has a relatively large influence on some key processes in the society. An example is the processing of personal and locally stored data. Examples of relevant student projects are an election system, a chat service with strong privacy, a rating system of specific skills, a cryptocurrency system and other systems based on consensus between two or more agents.</p>

    <p>(C-GPT) Blockchain represents a software and network architecture rooted in the foundational structure of the Internet. Key components of blockchain architecture include distributed storage units and communication protocols employed by autonomous agents to achieve consensus. Various models have been devised to assess the value of goods and services, and the landscape continues to evolve in tandem with legal and regulatory frameworks governing value exchange among individuals and larger collectives.</p>

    <p>This architecture derives its momentum from the diverse interests of individuals and groups. Despite its inherent volatility, it wields significant influence over crucial societal processes. One notable example is the handling of personal and locally stored data. Student projects in this domain may encompass the development of systems such as election platforms, privacy-focused chat services, skill-specific rating systems, cryptocurrency networks, and other consensus-driven systems involving two or more agents.</p>

    <td>Student have knowledge about models for blockchains currently in use</td>
    <td>Both "knowledge" and "models" are ambiguous concepts. What does it mean to have a knowledge about something? Let us say that it is to have a mental model in one's brain, that an individual is able to associate with some specific phenomenon inside himself or in the surroundings (environment). So in this context "knowledge about models" would be a (personally interpreted and therefore psychological) knowledge about other's mental models regarding the phenomenon (or buzzword?) Blockchain. Definition in Cambridge Dictionary (Cambridge Dictionary, 2023a) states that the Blockchain is <cite>a system used to make a digital record of all the occasions a cryptocurrency (= a digital currency such as bitcoin) is bought or sold, and that is constantly growing as more blocks are added.</cite> According to Oxford English Dictionary (Blockchain - Quick Search Results | Oxford English Dictionary, 2023) the Blockchain is <cite>A sequence of digital records linked using encryption and distributed and managed typically in a peer-to-peer network used esp. by cryptocurrencies as a secure and verifiable ledger of transactions; the technology underpinning this.</cite> A definition from Vikram Dhillon states <cite>A blockchain is a decentralized data structure with internal consistency maintained through consensus reached by all the users on the current state of the network.</cite> (Vikram Dhillon, 2021). Another author (Christophe Schinckus, 2020) provides the following description: <cite>Blockchain is a buzzword describing the current excitement for an innovative technology that could change and disrupt major industries and economic sectors. Blockchain technology has the promise to change all existing business models and make financial services cheaper contributing therefore to a better financial inclusion and, even a better economic wealth distribution.</cite>
 <br /> 
The definitions above indicate a considerable ambiguity of the blockchain concept, but they are not logically incompatibele. Blockchain can be considered as a system for storing digital records (or data structures) in a network of users (peers) engaged in transactions with each other (possibly transactions of some tokens that can represent money or anything) and keeping the stored records immutable (or safe by cryptological or other means) based on a consesus reached by all (ideally) peers in the network. This also can imply that each peer in the network has its own copy of all digital records made in this network. In other words, a network of users is collectivelly keeping verifiable digital records about activities in the network. The term "ledger" is often used, probably because of the similarity with the historical ledger concept from the accounting.
<br /> 
Why such an artifact (an implemented system called blockchain) is necessary? The answer to this question will be a large part of discussion in IS-312. For now, one hypothesis might be that it (blockchain) mirrors particular movements in parts of thee homo sapiens society, in particular, with an emphasis on mechanisms for exchange of value (related to both tangible and intangible assets) between the members or groups from the homo sapiens society.
<br />
<br />
  <cite>Blockchain is a disruptive technology that is revolutionizing information technology and represents a change in the cultural paradigm for how information is shared. Companies are rushing to understand how they can use blockchain technology to innovate processes, products, and transactions.  Blockchain technology is contributing to sustainable development goals (SDGs) from different points of view, such as supporting the realization of a sustainable supply chain, improving energy efficiency, enabling a circular economy, and promoting the creation of secure a and reliable smart cities. </cite>
  <cite>NFT use-cases will only grow in the future, and developers may eventually be able to tie them to everyday activities like ticket sales, proof of attendance, and fraud detection. Globally, the largest part of NFTs is represented by digital art, sports, and the entertainment industry, but there are countless potential areas of application of NFTs, such as tourism, carbon offsets, energy efficiency, virtual real estate, and consumer & luxury goods. Certain platforms have gone a step further into the virtual reality to showcase the NFTs to the extent of that reality. The emergence of mixed reality offers more collectibles and marketing opportunities which will stimulate more growth.</cite>
